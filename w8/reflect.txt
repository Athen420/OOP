n this workshop on smart pointers, I gained a deeper understanding of their advantages and how to use them effectively. Smart pointers provide automatic memory management, ensuring that memory is deallocated properly and preventing memory leaks. The key advantage of smart pointer syntax lies in its ability to handle memory management automatically, reducing the burden on the programmer. This allows us to focus more on the logic of our code rather than managing memory explicitly.

In the code I implemented for the workshop, I used std::unique_ptr to manage the combinedList object. With the smart pointer syntax, I was able to dynamically allocate memory for combinedList and avoid worrying about manually deallocating it later. The smart pointer took care of releasing the memory when the combinedList went out of scope, even in the presence of exceptions.

The difference between raw pointer syntax and smart pointer syntax in my solution is evident in memory management. In the raw pointer version, I had to explicitly allocate memory using new and remember to delete it at various points in the code to avoid memory leaks. This was cumbersome and prone to errors if I missed a delete statement. On the other hand, with smart pointer syntax, I used std::unique_ptr to create the object, and it automatically managed memory, deallocating the memory when the combinedList was no longer needed.

Overall, this workshop taught me the importance of using smart pointers for efficient memory management, preventing memory leaks, and simplifying code maintenance. It reinforced the idea that using smart pointers is a best practice in modern C++ programming. The knowledge gained from this workshop will undoubtedly help me write more robust and maintainable code in the future.
